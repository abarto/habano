This library contains a set of utility classes to provide information about memory usage, file systems and date/time of the system on which the JVM is running.

The information is obtained calling native libraries on each of the supported platforms through Java Native Access (JNA).

**This project depends on Java Native Access (JNA) which can be obtained from [here](https://jna.dev.java.net/)**

Feel free to post requests for new features or suggestions that can help improve the project. Right now I'm looking for feedback on the design and the usage of JNA.
